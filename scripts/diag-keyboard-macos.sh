  rmng-viewer keyboard diagnostic
============================================================
After you press ENTER the viewer launches with debug logging.

  1. Connect to your remote as usual.
  2. CLICK INTO the remote video window so it has focus — the
     key handler only runs while that window is focused.
  3. Then do the following SLOWLY, ~1 second between each:

       a. Tap Left Control       (press, hold 1s, release)
       b. Tap Left Command  (⌘)  (press, hold 1s, release)
       c. Tap Left Shift         (press, hold 1s, release)
       d. Tap Left Option   (⌥)  (press, hold 1s, release)
       e. Type once each:  Tab , Space , Enter
       f. Bug repro: hold ⌘, press Tab to switch AWAY from the
          viewer, Cmd+Tab BACK to it, then release ⌘.
       g. Tap Left Control once more, then try Tab / Space /
          Enter again — do they type now?

  4. QUIT the viewer (Cmd+Q or close the window) to finish.
