# RMNG — Architecture & Development

Architecture, the port/protocol map, the workspace layout, and the build prerequisites.
For running the hub, see the [Quick start](../README.md#quick-start); for the full build →
run → wizard → upgrade flow, see [DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md).

## The shape

The control-server exposes **five ports** plus an SMB clone-home share; a further automation surface (the daemon MCP) lives inside each clone.

| Port | Default | Transport | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1 — video** | `9001` | framed H.264 over TCP | the selected clone's monitors to the native GTK viewer, with input + clipboard + cursor back |
| **2 — web API** | `9000` | HTTP + SSE (+ embedded frontend) | the React management UI: host selection, clone/Linear/Claude/chat orchestration, settings |
| **3 — per-clone MCP** | `9002` | HTTP JSON-RPC, header-routed | the in-clone agent reports its verdict (`set_state`); caller self-identifies via the `x-rmng-clone` header |
| **4 — global MCP** | `9003` | HTTP JSON-RPC | the desktop/window tools only (with a `clone` selector), proxied to the clone's daemon MCP; fleet management lives in the `rmng` CLI over port 2 |
| **5 — forward** | `9005` | framed TCP over TCP | the viewer's port-forwarding data plane: one TCP connection per accepted local socket, spliced to the clone |
| **SMB** | `445` | SMB (smbd) | the `clones` share — browse every running clone's `/home/rmng` from `smb://<host>/clones` (fixed cred `rmng`/`rmng`) |
| daemon MCP | `9004` | HTTP JSON-RPC (in each clone) | the full desktop-automation surface; the agent calls it on localhost, the global MCP proxies to it |
| clone socket | `/srv/rmng-sock/clones.sock` | unix `SOCK_SEQPACKET` | clone-daemon ⇄ control-server: dmabuf frames (`SCM_RIGHTS`) out, input/clipboard in |

**Design in one breath:** one central encoder, thin clones (no g-r-d / GDM / RDP — just
`gnome-session` + the daemon); one capture feeds both the human viewer and the agent's
screenshots; raw H.264-over-TCP into zero-copy VA-API decode gives RFX-class feel without RDP;
media/input cross a host unix socket, not the network, so only the control-server is externally
reachable. `docker run` the control-server container, open the browser, and the first-run
setup wizard pulls the pre-built clone **template** — a separate published image
(`pegasis0/rmng-template`) that already carries the patched gnome-shell — and finishes setup.
Clone binaries (and the `rmng` CLI) are injected into each clone at create time from the
running server's payloads; there's no manual redeploy step.

## Documentation

| [PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md) | The port-1 video/input/clipboard/cursor wire protocol, the clone socket, the config schema, every env var, the clone-daemon CLI, and the per-crate public API |
| [SCRIPTS.md](SCRIPTS.md) | Every script: what it does, where it runs, its args, and what invokes it |
| [DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md) | The Docker build → run → wizard → images/clones flow, the image build, upgrades, clone-home browsing, and the dev loop |

## Workspace map

| Path | Kind | What |
|---|---|---|
| [crates/wire](../crates/wire/README.md) | lib | shared types: control state, config, the clone socket + viewer protocols, MCP DTOs; ts-rs export for the frontend |
| [crates/control-server](../crates/control-server/README.md) | bin | the server: media plane, web API/SSE, per-clone + global MCP, port-forward + SMB planes, Docker orchestration (bollard), on-disk frontend + clone payloads, clone-template pull + create-time clone-binary injection |
| [crates/media](../crates/media/README.md) | lib | dmabuf ingest → VA-API H.264 per monitor + dmabuf→JPEG screenshots + the clone-socket transport |
| [crates/clone-daemon](../crates/clone-daemon/README.md) | bin | the thin in-clone pipe: RecordVirtual capture, RemoteDesktop input inject, clipboard bridge, the desktop MCP (:9004), and the needs-human detector |
| [crates/viewer](../crates/viewer/README.md) | bin | the native GTK client (GUI + headless test mode): zero-copy VA-API decode, multi-monitor, client-drawn cursor, input + pointer-lock + clipboard |
| [crates/control-client](../crates/control-client/README.md) | lib | typed reqwest+SSE client for the port-2 web API (`/api/state`, `/events`, clone/delete/image/account wrappers); used by the `rmng` CLI and integration tests |
| [crates/cli](../crates/cli/README.md) | bin | the `rmng` fleet CLI: hosts/clones/images/accounts/operations over the port-2 web API; injected into every clone as `/usr/local/bin/rmng` |
| [frontend](../frontend/README.md) | web app | React Router 7 management UI, ts-rs types from `wire`, served by the control-server |
| [gnome-patch](../gnome-patch/README.md) | tooling | builds the patched gnome-shell `.deb` (hide screen-share indicator + enable `Eval` for window-mgmt); built + installed by `template/Dockerfile`'s `gnome-build` stage into the published clone template — not a control-server payload |

The per-clone **agent-wrapper** (Bun, Claude Agent SDK) is vendored at `agent-wrapper/`; the
control-server installs its current build into each clone at create time (the template
doesn't carry it) and proxies chat to it. Its `desktop` MCP points at the clone-daemon
(`http://127.0.0.1:9004`).

## Clean-room

`RMNG` is its own Cargo workspace (own lockfile, edition 2024). It does **not** import the
old client (`../core`, `../gtk`, `../headless`), the old `../control-server`, or
`../computer-use` — those are reference material for proven techniques, re-expressed fresh. The
one preserved contract is the JSON wire format of `/events` and the web API, so the React
frontend works unchanged.

<a id="prerequisites"></a>
## Prerequisites

Rust (edition 2024), `bun`, `clang`/`libclang`; `libpipewire-0.3-dev`, `libva-dev` + AMD VA-API
(radeonsi/Mesa), `libdrm-dev`, GStreamer + **`gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad`** (the `va` elements —
*not* `gstreamer1.0-va`), GTK4; a GPU render node (`/dev/dri/renderD128`) on the control-server
host *and* every clone. With those dev libs the **whole workspace compiles on a plain laptop**
(a bare box without them builds only `wire`); the GPU box is only needed to *run* the
capture/encode/server side — the **`viewer` builds *and* runs locally** (client-side decode).
See the [dev loop](DEPLOY.md#the-dev-loop). **The clone template is built on the
`ubuntu:26.04` base OS** (the patched gnome-shell is compiled against 26.04's GNOME only) —
see [Publishing the template](DEPLOY.md#publishing-the-template).
