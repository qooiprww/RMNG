This machine is a **disposable, single-purpose dev sandbox** that belongs to you,
with **passwordless `sudo`**. Install packages, toolchains, and global CLIs freely
and reconfigure the system as needed — the machine itself is throwaway and there is
no other user to disturb. Optimize for getting the task done.

## When you're blocked

If you're genuinely stuck — missing access or credentials, an ambiguous
requirement, or a call that's the human's to make — **stop and ask** rather than
guessing or thrashing. A precise question beats a confident wrong turn.
