#
# RMNG control-server image (BuildKit multi-stage). `docker build -t rmng:latest .` is
# the canonical build — it replaces the retired build CT. Everything (rust toolchain,
# gstreamer/libva/libdrm/pipewire dev deps, bun) lives in build stages; the runtime stage
# carries only the GStreamer/VA runtime the server needs to ingest clone dmabufs and
# VA-API encode. The W6800 GPU is a RUNTIME requirement, not a build one.
#
# Nothing is compiled into the server binary (rust-embed is gone): the runtime stage
# assembles /usr/local/share/rmng/ — the plain clone-daemon + agent-wrapper binaries and
# static/ (the frontend) — which assets.rs/web.rs read at runtime. (The patched
# gnome-shell .deb is no longer a control-server payload: the retired in-product bootstrap
# was its only consumer; the clone template — which needs it — is now built by
# template/Dockerfile.) Payloads are stored UNcompressed (no gzip: it only ever existed to
# keep the rust-embed blob small; registry pushes compress layers anyway). The two build
# stages are fully independent, so BuildKit runs them in parallel and a source-only rust
# change rebuilds only the rust layers.
#
# Stages:
#   1. bun-build   — frontend (react-router → frontend/build/client) + agent-wrapper
#                    (bun build --compile).
#   2. rust-build  — rustup stable; dev deps; cargo build --release clone-daemon
#                    + control-server.
#   3. runtime     — ubuntu:26.04, runtime libs + samba (smbd serves clone homes over SMB)
#                    + /usr/local/share/rmng payloads (2 binaries + static/), a local rmng
#                    uid-1000 user for the share, WORKDIR /data, EXPOSE 9000-9003 9005 445.
