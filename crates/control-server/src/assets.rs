//! Runtime payload assets. The Docker image ships everything the control-server
//! distributes (and the frontend it serves) on the filesystem under
//! [`INSTALL_DIR`] — the `clone-daemon` and `agent-wrapper` binaries and `static/`
//! (the built frontend). Everything is stored PLAIN (no gzip — registry pushes
//! compress layers anyway) and nothing is compiled into the binary (rust-embed is
//! gone): a payload is looked up at use time with a two-entry search path — the
//! image install dir first, then the repo dev dir — so `cargo run -p control-server`
//! from a checkout picks up locally staged payloads and the dev frontend build
//! without any configuration.
